# Assembly07

Use an interrupt time base.   Use timer 0 with a pre-scalar per you last name to do so.  Set up the interrupt and increment a counter each time the interrupt occurs.  In the end you should have a ½ second time base. Use the rotate left or right command depending on your last name. The transitions thru each led should be smooth with the right time base.

In this assignment you will be initializing timer 0 and letting it run.  Set the pre-scaler per your last name below:
 
 
A-G  1 : 64 rotate right
H-P 1 : 128 rotate left
Q-Z  1 : 256 rotate left

1.	Write a Microchip assembly language program that initializes timer 0 and runs timer.
2.	Print out your .asm  file.
3.	Demonstrate the timer running to your instructor by showing the led’s rotate every ½ second.
4.	Show math and how you determined the number stuffed into timer 0.
